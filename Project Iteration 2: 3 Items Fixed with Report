1) Pasword Protection using system's keyring. Now, it stores the password in encrypted file in the home directory. 
2) Two-Factor Aunthentication: Now the user needs to choose a security question, give an answer and after that every time the user tries to log In, it will ask
for username, password and if they are accurate, then it will ask for a the security question's answer. If it is accurate, it will log in if not, it will ask again.
3) The username now includes @eagle.fgcu.edu as identifier of students in a university. Also now the default password doesn't include the username in it since username
is public data.
